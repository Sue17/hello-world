# hello-world
My first repository, following steps in the Hello World GitHub Guide: https://guides.github.com/
4/29/15: Just found out how to make a branch and what that means -- I look forward to becoming GitHub proficient.
There are several other guides -- I should do the following at the least:
1 Getting your project on GitHub
2 Understanding the GitHub Flow
3 Forking Projects
4 Mastering Issues
5 Mastering Markdown (the markup language of GitHub)
6 Mastering Wikis (create a wiki for your project and add content)
7 Getting Started with GitHub Pages (host a blog, showcase open source projects, share your resume)
8 Be Social and Making your code citable and Contributing to open source on GitHub are all for future - after I master the basics.
